## About The Project
This project is an interactive travel packing list built entirely with React. It demonstrates fundamental concepts including component-based architecture, state management with hooks (useState), passing props ("lifting state up"), handling user events, and derived state. It's a great example of a simple yet fully functional single-page application.

## Features ‚ú®
Add Items: Dynamically add new items with a specific quantity to your list.

Delete Items: Easily remove items you no longer need with a single click.

Pack Items: Mark items as packed with an interactive checkbox, which updates the UI with a strikethrough style.

Smart Sorting: Sort your list by input order, description, packed status, or quantity.

Live Stats: Get instant feedback on your packing progress with a dynamic stats footer that shows the total number of items and the percentage packed.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
React: For building the dynamic user interface and managing component state.

JavaScript (ES6+): For the application logic.

CSS: For custom styling and layout.
